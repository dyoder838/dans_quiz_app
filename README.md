# dans_quiz_app

This app is a real benchmark test of my coding ability as I progress through my course in web development; it has been a real challenge and a huge learning opportunity.

the goal is to make a timed quiz. 

the rules are simple, a timer starts when the quiz starts. 
 - the player has 60 seconds to finish the quiz.
 - 5 seconds are subtracted for every incorrect answer.
 - points are tallied at the end of the quiz and given a score equal to correct answers per second multiplied by 1000 - because who likes low numbers
 - the user gets to enter their initials next to their score and the score remains in local storage

coding this required use of:

javascript
jquery
css
arrays
for loops
local storage
intervals
if else statements 

at the time of writing this, the project has yet to be completed, one can follow my progress using my github repository:

One can see the app in action here:
