# dans_quiz_app

This app is a real benchmark test of my coding ability as I progress through my course in web development; it has been a real challenge and a huge learning opportunity.

The goal of this project is to make a timed quiz. 

The rules are simple, a timer starts when the quiz starts. 
 - A player has 60 seconds to finish the quiz.
 - 5 seconds are subtracted for every incorrect answer.
 - Points are tallied at the end of the quiz and given a score equal to correct answers per second multiplied by 1000 - because who likes low numbers.
 - A player gets to enter their initials next to their score and the score remains in local storage.

Coding this required use of:

javascript
jquery
css
arrays
for loops
local storage
intervals
if else statements 

At the time of this writing, the project has yet to be completed. 
    - Scoring is incomplete
    - localStorage is incomplete
    - CSS is incomplete
    - Endgame is incomplete
